## Practice Statement - Unique Arrays

**A company has revamped the health insurance policy for all its insured employees and has increased their health cover by 20%. In order to provide them this facility, the human resource department needs to collect the data of all insured employees and prepare a unique list of their employee ids.​ Write a program to help the HR manager to create a unique list of employee ids to avoid duplication.​​**

### Example 

    Sample Input :
        int[] salesDepartmentEmpIds = {101,105,106,107,108,109};
    Sample Output:
        true
    ---------------------------------------------
    Sample Input :
        int[] accountDepartmentEmpIds = {201,205,206,207,208,209,201};
    Sample Output:
        false



# Practice Statement - Shortest word 

**Write a Java program to get the strings as input from the user and push them to an array. Find the shortest word in the list of strings and display the same on the screen.**

**Sample Input**

	words[] = {"Atrocity", "Pensive", "Imperceptible", "Discordant" }

**Sample Output**

	Shortest word is Pensive
	
	
# Practice Statement: Calorie Tracker

**Anne is using a calorie tracker app that helps her keep a record of all her physical activities and her daily intake of calories**
**The calories burned by her doing some of the common physical activities are:**

1. 30 minutes of cycling burns around 300 calories
2. 30 minutes of swimming burns around 200 calories
3. 30 minutes of running burns around 500 calories

**Anne can lose one pound of weight for each 1000 calories burned. Her daily extra calorie intake tracked by the app is 100**
**Write a java program to calculate the number of pounds Anne can lose in a month if she does each of the above mentioned activities
once a week for 1 hour and chooses to do one activity per day.**


**Sample Input:**

    Calorie burnt by cycling : 200
    Calorie burnt by running : 200
    Calorie burnt by swimming: 200
    Calorie intake in a day  : 100

**Sample Output:**

    Weight lost by Anne in a month is : 5.0 pounds

# Pratice Statement: Fencing a Barn

**   Ron wishes to renovate his barn. He thinks that creating fences and keeping the animals separately would help him feed the animals easily and prevent the problem of animals getting mixed. For this, he plans to divide the area into three parts. He wishes to have a square area for the chickens, a circular area for the ducks and a rectangular area for the cows.​**
**Write a program in Java to help Ron calculate the area for each fence separately.**
Note: 
- Input ‘side’ for the square, ‘length and breadth’ for rectangle and ‘radius’ for circle.   
- Modularize your code by writing separate functions to calculate the area of each of the fence shapes.

**Sample Input:**

    Select an option from list to calculate area of fence
    1. Square area for the chickens
    2. Circular area for ducks
    3. Rectangular area for cows

    1
    Enter side of square : 12

**Sample Output:**

    Area of square fence for chickens is 144.0
